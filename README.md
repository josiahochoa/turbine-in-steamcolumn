# turbine-in-steamcolumn

To be announced. 

## Implementation

To implement this script file it is necessary to input vectors tr and tamb filled with experimental data. To call the function simply set a variable equal to it like so:

c = steamturbineData(tr, tamb)

It is important to note that this function was designed to work specifically for the equation given and is not recommended to use in other scenarios.
